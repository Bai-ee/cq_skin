## Executive Summary

**Critters Quest** is a 4X strategy game built on Solana that combines:
- **Fair token distribution** via SOV-style (SOV Mining Protocol) mining protocol
- **Real gameplay utility** with sustainable in-game economy
- **NFT progression** with Master Edition yield mechanisms
- **Community-first tokenomics** with 59% pre-launch burn

**Key Stats:**
- Total Supply: 4.09B $QUEST (59.1% burned pre-launch)
- Community Allocation: 70.4% (Master Editions + SOV Mining + Rewards)
- Team Allocation: 10% (6-month cliff + 1-year vesting = 18 months total)
- Initial Circulating: 0.49% (ultra-tight float)
- Target Market Cap: $50-100M circulating by Month 6-12

**What Makes Us Different:**
- Largest pre-launch burn in Solana GameFi (59%)
- Fair launch via SOV mining (no VC dumps)
- Real 4X strategy game (beta live)
- Sustainable tokenomics (game sinks feed treasury)
- Master Edition yield (perpetual SOL revenue)

---

## The Problem with GameFi

### Traditional GameFi Model Failures

**Problem 1: Extractive Tokenomics**
- High inflation (50-100%+ annually)
- No sustainable sinks
- "Play to earn" becomes "play to dump"
- Token price collapses within weeks

**Problem 2: Unfair Distribution**
- VCs get 20-40% at massive discounts
- Team gets 15-25% with short locks
- Community gets dumped on at launch
- Insiders exit at 10-100x while public buys the top

**Problem 3: No Real Utility**
- Token is just "governance" or staking rewards
- No actual burn mechanisms
- Game is secondary to token speculation
- Dies when speculation ends

**Problem 4: Unsustainable Yields**
- Promise 1,000%+ APY to attract players
- Funded by new player money (Ponzi-like)
- Collapses when new players stop coming
- No real value creation

### Why 95% of GameFi Projects Fail

```
Traditional GameFi Lifecycle:

Month 1: Launch → Massive hype → Token pumps 10-100x
Month 2: VCs unlock → Massive selling → Price crashes 50%
Month 3: Team unlocks → More selling → Price crashes another 50%
Month 4: Yield farmers leave → No new players → Price death spiral
Month 6: Game development stops → Project abandoned
```

**The core issue:** Bad tokenomics + extractive model + no sustainable utility

---

## The Critters Quest Solution

### Our Philosophy: GameFi Done Right

**1. Fair Launch Distribution**
```
No VCs, no presale whales, no insider dumps.

70.4% to community:
├─ 58.2% Master Editions (3,500 NFT holders)
├─ 12.2% SOV Mining (provably fair distribution)
└─ 2.4% Genesis Quest (staking rewards)

Only 10% to team (6-month cliff + vesting)
Only 4.9% to marketing (minimal)

Result: Community owns the project
```

**2. Sustainable Token Sinks**
```
Traditional GameFi: Print tokens → Give to players → Players sell → Death spiral

Critters Quest: Players spend tokens for advantages → 20% replenishes mining treasury → Buybacks burn tokens → Sustainable loop

Game actions that spend $QUEST:
├─ Unit purchases
├─ Building upgrades
├─ Territory expansion
├─ Speedups
└─ Competitive advantages

Result: More players = more spending = sustainable treasury + buyback burns
```

**3. Multiple Revenue Streams**
```
Traditional GameFi: Only token speculation

Critters Quest:
├─ SOV Mining (earn SOL + $QUEST)
├─ QUEST Staking (earn 2% of mining volume in SOL)
├─ Master Edition yield (earn 1% of mining volume perpetually)
├─ Game progression (earn rewards through gameplay)
└─ NFT royalties (Master Edition cloning)

Result: Multiple ways to earn, not just token price
```

**4. Aligned Incentives**
```
Traditional GameFi: Team dumps after unlock

Critters Quest:
├─ Team has 6-month cliff (skin in game)
├─ ME holders earn perpetual revenue (never sell)
├─ Stakers earn SOL passively (better to hold)
├─ Refining fee (10% penalty on quick claims)
└─ Buybacks (7% constant buy pressure)

Result: Everyone benefits from long-term success
```

## Game Overview

### What is Critters Quest?

**A 4X strategy game** where players:
- **eXplore** territories and discover resources
- **eXpand** their empire across the map
- **eXploit** resources for economic advantage
- **eXterminate** rivals in strategic combat

**Built on Solana** for:
- Fast transactions (400ms block times)
- Low fees ($0.00025 per transaction)
- On-chain progression (provably fair)
- NFT integration (Master Editions as units)

### Core Gameplay Loop

```
1. Start with Master Edition NFT (warrior or gatherer)
   ├─ Each NFT has unique stats and abilities
   └─ Can level up through gameplay

2. Gather resources
   ├─ Deploy gatherer NFTs to resource nodes
   ├─ Collect wood, stone, ore, food
   └─ Resources used for building and upgrades

3. Build empire
   ├─ Construct buildings (farms, barracks, workshops)
   ├─ Upgrade infrastructure for bonuses
   └─ Expand territory for more resources

4. Combat & Strategy
   ├─ Deploy warrior NFTs in battles
   ├─ Form alliances with other players
   ├─ Compete for territory control
   └─ Strategic depth (rock-paper-scissors combat)

5. Economic Competition
   ├─ Control resource nodes = economic power
   ├─ Trade with other players
   ├─ Manipulate markets
   └─ Win through economic dominance
```

### Master Edition NFTs (3,500 Total)

**What are Master Editions?**
- Unique character NFTs with combat/gathering abilities
- Can be "cloned" into Public Edition NFTs for gameplay
- Master Edition holders earn 2.5% royalty on all clone mints
- Earn perpetual yield from SOV mining protocol
- Beta access to game before public launch

**Two Types:**
1. **Warriors** - Combat-focused with attack/defense stats
2. **Gatherers** - Resource-focused with gathering efficiency

**Progression System:**
- Level up through gameplay (XP from battles/gathering)
- Unlock new abilities at milestone levels
- Improve stats with equipment and upgrades
- Permanent on-chain progression (never resets)

### Public Edition NFTs

**For Players Without Master Editions:**
- Mint "clones" of Master Editions to play
- Lower stats than originals but fully playable
- Cheaper entry point ($5-20 vs $350 for Master Edition)
- Can still progress and compete
- 2.5% of mint fees go back to Master Edition holder

## Tokenomics

### Supply & Distribution

**Total Supply: 4,089,481,331 $QUEST (~4.09B)**

From original 10B supply, **59.1% burned before TGE**:

```
Original 10B Supply Breakdown:

KEPT:
├─ 2.88B Master Editions (bound to NFTs)
├─ 500M SOV Mining Pool (from ME unlocks)
├─ 100M Genesis Quest (staking rewards)
├─ 200M Marketing (CEX/partnerships only)
└─ 409M Team (10% with 6-month cliff)

BURNED:
├─ 2.12B Already burned (bonding curve)
├─ 2.00B DEX allocation (not needed)
├─ 1.70B Marketing excess (keeping only 200M)
└─ 591M Team excess (proportional reduction)

Total Burned: 5.91B (59.1%)
Final Supply: 4.09B
```

### Token Allocation

```
Final 4.09B Distribution:

58.2% Master Editions (2,380,533,198 QUEST)
├─ Bound to 3,500 NFT holders
├─ Unlockable via Genesis Quest staking
└─ Cannot be dumped (locked to NFTs)

12.2% SOV Mining Pool (500,000,000 QUEST)
├─ Sourced from ME unlocked tokens
├─ Distributed via fair mining over 1 year
└─ Contributors earn 1% SOL revenue forever

10.0% Team (408,948,133 QUEST)
├─ 6-month cliff (zero unlock)
├─ Then 52 weekly unlocks (~7.86M/week)
├─ Total duration: 18 months from TGE
└─ Maximum alignment with long-term success

4.9% Marketing (200,000,000 QUEST)
├─ CEX listings
├─ Strategic partnerships
└─ Ecosystem growth only

2.4% Genesis Quest (100,000,000 QUEST)
├─ Rewards for current stakers
└─ Earned through time-locked staking

---
12.3% Used for TGE setup:
├─ 20M Presale (0.49%)
└─ Pre-seed mining (optional)
```

### Emission Schedule

**Dynamic Emission Model:**
```
Emission per round = Treasury Balance / 525,600 minutes

Initial State:
├─ Treasury: 500M QUEST
├─ Divisor: 525,600 (1 year in minutes)
├─ Emission: 951 QUEST/round
└─ Round duration: 1 minute

As Treasury Depletes:
├─ Emissions decrease proportionally
├─ Game sinks replenish treasury (20% of burns)
└─ Becomes self-sustaining with active game

Example:
├─ Month 1: 951 QUEST/round
├─ Month 6: ~476 QUEST/round (50% depleted)
├─ Month 12: ~238 QUEST/round (75% depleted)
└─ With game sinks: Stabilizes at sustainable rate
```

### Circulating Supply Progression

| Timeline | Emissions | Total Available | Expected Staked | Actually Circulating |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Launch | 0 | 20M | 15M (75%) | 5M (0.12%) |
| Week 1 | 9.6M | 29.6M | 18M (60%) | 11.6M (0.28%) |
| Month 1 | 41M | 61M | 37M (60%) | 24M (0.59%) |
| Month 3 | 123M | 143M | 86M (60%) | 57M (1.4%) |
| Month 6 | 247M | 267M | 160M (60%) | 107M (2.6%) |
| Month 12 | 494M | 903M | 540M (60%) | 363M (8.9%) |

**Key Insight:** Only 0.12-2.6% circulating for first 6 months = extreme scarcity

## SOV Mining Protocol

### What is SOV Mining?

**Built on ORE Protocol V2 infrastructure:**
- Provably fair random winner selection
- Anyone can participate (no expensive hardware)
- Multiple winners per round (not winner-take-all)
- Constant buy pressure from protocol buybacks

**How It Works:**

```
Step 1: Deploy SOL on 5x5 Grid
├─ 25 blocks available per round
├─ Players stake SOL on any block
├─ Stake any amount (min 0.00001 SOL)
└─ Can deploy on multiple blocks

Step 2: Random Winner Selection (1 minute rounds)
├─ Secure random number generator picks winning block
├─ Uses Entropy VRF (provably fair)
├─ 1/625 chance to trigger motherlode jackpot
└─ Winners announced immediately

Step 3: Rewards Distribution
Winners receive:
├─ 88% of losing blocks' SOL (proportional to stake)
├─ 951 QUEST from treasury (proportional to stake)
└─ Potential motherlode jackpot (SOL only)

Other distributions:
├─ 7% → Buyback $QUEST & burn (deflationary)
├─ 2% → QUEST stakers (anyone staking)
├─ 1% → ME contributors (who provided tokens)
└─ 2% → Motherlode pool (accumulates for jackpot)
```

### Why Mine?

**Dual Rewards:**
- Earn SOL profit (88% of losers' stakes)
- Earn $QUEST emissions (951/round initially)

**Example Round:**
```
You stake: 0.1 SOL on Block #13
Total on Block #13: 2 SOL (from 10 players)
Your share of block: 5%

If Block #13 wins:
├─ Total losing SOL: 8 SOL (from other 24 blocks)
├─ Winners get 88%: 7.04 SOL distributed
├─ Your 5% share: 0.352 SOL
├─ Your profit: 0.352 - 0.1 = 0.252 SOL = $35 profit
│
└─ Plus QUEST: 951 × 5% = 48 QUEST = $0.67 (at $0.014)

Total earnings: $35.67 from 0.1 SOL stake = 35,667% ROI if you win
```

**If Block #13 loses:**
- You lose your 0.1 SOL stake
- But contributed to winners' rewards
- Try again next round (1 minute)

### Motherlode Jackpot

**How It Works:**
- 2% of each round's SOL accumulates
- 1/625 probability per round
- If triggered, entire pool distributed to winning block
- SOL only (no QUEST, reduces sell pressure)

**Example:**
```
After 625 rounds at 10 SOL average:
├─ Accumulated: 125 SOL in motherlode
├─ Probability triggers: 1/625 this round
├─ Winners on Block split: 125 SOL = $17,500
└─ Your 5% share: 6.25 SOL = $875 bonus
```

### Mining Strategies

**Conservative (Lower Risk):**
- Deploy small amounts across multiple blocks
- Diversify risk
- Lower variance but consistent small wins

**Aggressive (Higher Risk):**
- Deploy large amount on single block
- All-or-nothing approach
- Huge wins when hit, total loss when miss

**Automated:**
- Use automation bots (available in protocol)
- Set deployment strategy
- Runs 24/7 without manual intervention

## Master Edition NFTs

### What Are Master Editions?

**Limited to 3,500 NFTs total:**
- First 1,000 sold at 2.5 SOL each (sold out)
- Next 1,500 sold via bonding curve (sold out)
- Final 1,000 sold 8 months later (sold out)
- No more can ever be created

**Dual Utility:**

1. **Game Characters**
   - Playable warriors or gatherers
   - Level up through gameplay
   - Superior stats to Public Editions
   - Exclusive beta access

2. **Yield-Generating Assets**
   - Earn from Public Edition minting (2.5% royalty)
   - Earn from SOV mining (1% of SOL volume)
   - Earn from Genesis Quest staking
   - Earn from game achievements

### Genesis Quest Staking

**What Is It?**
- Stake Master Edition NFT to unlock bound $QUEST
- Unlock rate: 0.1% per day + multiplier boosts
- Unlocked tokens contributed to SOV mining pool
- Contributors earn perpetual 1% SOL revenue

**The Flow:**
```
1. Stake Master Edition
   ├─ NFT locked (cannot trade while staked)
   └─ Begin unlocking bound QUEST

2. Accumulate Unlocked QUEST
   ├─ Base: 0.1%/day
   ├─ Boosts: Up to 2-3x from multipliers
   └─ Example: 200 days = 20% unlocked

3. Contribute to SOV Mining Pool
   ├─ Deposit unlocked QUEST to pool
   ├─ Snapshot taken (locks total contributions)
   └─ Your % calculated: (your_contribution / total) × 10,000 = share_bps

4. Earn Perpetual Revenue
   ├─ 1% of all mining SOL → contributor pool
   ├─ Your share_bps × pool = your earnings
   ├─ Example: 0.16% share × 144 SOL/day = 0.23 SOL/day = $8,395/year
   └─ Earns FOREVER as long as mining continues

5. NFT Becomes Tradeable Yield Asset
   ├─ Revenue rights transfer with NFT sale
   ├─ New owner inherits your earnings stream
   └─ Permanent value accrual to NFT
```

**Example Contributor:**
```
ME holder with 2M QUEST bound:
├─ Stakes 300 days with 2x boost
├─ Unlocks: 2M × 0.1% × 300 × 2 = 1.2M QUEST
├─ Contributes: 1.2M to mining pool
│
If total pool = 500M:
├─ Share: 1.2M / 500M = 0.24% = 24 bps
├─ Daily mining: 14,400 SOL
├─ 1% to contributors: 144 SOL/day
├─ Your 0.24%: 0.35 SOL/day = $49/day
└─ Annual: $17,885 in SOL

Plus keeps: 800K QUEST still bound
Plus earns: 2.5% royalty on cloning
```

### Public Edition Cloning

**How It Works:**
- Players can "clone" any Master Edition
- Creates inferior copy (70% stats) for gameplay
- Clone costs: $5-20 in $QUEST (burns most)
- 2.5% of cost goes to Master Edition holder

**Revenue for ME Holders:**
```
If your Master Edition gets cloned 1,000 times at $10 each:
├─ Total clone revenue: $10,000
├─ Your 2.5% royalty: $250
├─ In $QUEST: $250 / $0.014 = 17,857 QUEST
└─ Passive income from your NFT

Popular Master Editions = more clones = more revenue
```

---

## Revenue Model

### How the Protocol Makes Money

**1. DLMM Trading Fees (Team Revenue)**
```
Liquidity Pool: Meteora DLMM
├─ Fee: 2% per trade (higher than standard 0.25-1%)
├─ Initial LP: 1,600 SOL + 16M QUEST
└─ All fees → Team treasury

If daily volume = $500K:
├─ Daily fees: $10,000
├─ Monthly fees: $300,000
└─ Annual fees: $3.6M

Milestone: 10,000 SOL collected
├─ Refund: 2,500 SOL to Edition 2501+ holders
└─ Rewards later adopters who paid full price
```

**2. Game Transaction Fees**
```
All in-game $QUEST transactions:
├─ Players spend tokens for advantages
├─ 20% goes to SOV mining treasury (sustainability)
└─ 80% goes to protocol revenue

If 10M QUEST spent monthly in game:
├─ 2M replenishes mining pool
├─ 8M to protocol operations
└─ Only buybacks from mining actually burn tokens
```

**3. NFT Minting Revenue**
```
Public Edition Clones:
├─ Cost: $5-20 in $QUEST
├─ 2.5% to Master Edition holder
├─ Remaining burned or to treasury
└─ Drives $QUEST demand

Master Edition Trading Royalties:
├─ 5% royalty on secondary sales
└─ Revenue to original creators/team
```

### Revenue Distribution

**Team Treasury (from DLMM fees):**
- Development & operations
- Marketing & partnerships
- CEX listing fees
- Team compensation
- Bug bounties & audits

**Master Edition Holders (multiple streams):**
- 1% of mining SOL volume
- 2.5% of Public Edition minting
- 5% of secondary sale royalties
- Genesis Quest staking rewards

**QUEST Stakers:**
- 2% of mining SOL volume
- Distributed proportionally to stake

**Protocol (self-sustaining):**
- 20% of game burns → treasury
- Replenishes mining emissions
- Sustainable without external funding
