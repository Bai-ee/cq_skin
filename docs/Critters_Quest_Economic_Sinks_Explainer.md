Critters Quest is a 4X strategy GameFi ecosystem built on Solana. Unlike most GameFi projects that promise sustainability but deliver inflation, Critters Quest was designed with **token sinks first**, then wrapped an economy around them. This document explains every way $QUEST tokens leave circulation and why the economy is built to last.

## THE CORE PROBLEM WITH GAMEFI

Most GameFi projects fail because they print tokens infinitely with no real removal mechanism. Players earn tokens, dump them, price crashes, game dies. Critters Quest solves this by ensuring you don't earn $QUEST directly—you earn **resources** through skilled gameplay that can be swapped for $QUEST through natural price discovery.

---

## THE TOKEN: $QUEST

$QUEST powers the entire Critters Quest ecosystem. Each Master Edition NFT has locked $QUEST tokens allocated directly to its **Token-Bound Account (TBA)**—not your wallet, but the NFT itself. This means the tokens travel with the NFT if sold, creating inherent value in every Master Edition.

### Token-Bound Accounts

Token-Bound Accounts are smart contract wallets that allow NFTs to directly own and control assets. Your Critter NFT and Town NFT each have their own wallet. All resources, tools, equipment, and $QUEST are stored **on the NFT itself**, not in your personal wallet. This creates true asset ownership at the character level.

---

## THE SINKS: WHERE $QUEST LEAVES CIRCULATION

Here's every mechanism that removes $QUEST from circulation or creates demand:

### 1. Movement Costs

Every action on the world map costs $QUEST. Moving your Critters to resource nodes, attacking monsters, visiting other players' bases, and exploring new regions all require $QUEST expenditure. The cost scales with distance and time, creating constant token demand from active players.

### 2. Upgrades & Crafting

Upgrading your town, workshops, walls, bank, jeweler, and other buildings requires $QUEST. Crafting higher-tier items, socketing gems into tools, and creating potions at the Bubbling Barrel all consume tokens. As your town level increases, costs scale accordingly.

### 3. Building Control

Teams compete to control strategic buildings scattered across the world map. Tokens flow **into** these buildings as players stake and compete for control. Controlling a building provides staking rewards, but maintaining control requires ongoing token commitment. The **World Bank** is the ultimate prize—a central territorial objective that provides significant economic advantages to the controlling team.

### 4. Clone Consumption (Promotion Burns) ⭐

**This is the big one.** Both Master Editions and Clones can be **promoted** to become stronger by **consuming other Clones**. When you promote a character:

- The consumed Clone is permanently burned from supply
- Your character gains permanent stat increases
- The $QUEST allocated to that Clone is removed from circulation
- Supply decreases while demand remains (deflationary pressure)

**Master Editions cannot be consumed**—only Clones burn. This creates perpetual demand for Clones from players wanting to power up their main characters.

### 5. Rent Mechanics (Fresh Finds)

Fresh Finds and certain map features require rent payments. You're paying for space you don't permanently own—when the rent period ends, that $QUEST is gone. This creates risk/reward decisions: higher rent costs for better bonuses and positioning.

### 6. Tool Minting & Destruction

Tools are essential for efficient gathering and combat. Minting and upgrading tools costs $QUEST (and sometimes SOL). Tools can also be **destroyed** during certain gameplay events, requiring players to remake them and spend tokens again.

---

## THE CLONE ECONOMY FLYWHEEL

The Clone system creates a self-reinforcing economic loop:

1. **Minting Phase:** Players mint Clones from Master Editions to expand their population. Master Editions earn SOL from each mint.

2. **Trading Phase:** Players buy and sell Clones on secondary markets. Master Editions earn SOL royalties (50-75% depending on boosts).

3. **Consumption Phase:** Players consume Clones to promote their characters. Clones are permanently burned.

4. **Scarcity Phase:** Reduced supply increases demand for remaining Clones. Cycle repeats with higher floor prices.

---

## THE RESOURCE ECONOMY (THE SWAP)

Players don't earn $QUEST directly—they earn **resources**. All resources exist as tradeable tokens that can be swapped for $QUEST through The Swap, built on Meteora's DLMM technology.

### Natural Price Discovery

The team seeds each resource pool with **one-sided $QUEST liquidity only**. The resource side develops organically as players gather, mine, and harvest materials. When players choose to sell resources for $QUEST, natural price discovery occurs based on actual supply and demand—scarce resources from difficult locations command higher prices.

### 100+ Liquidity Pools

Over 100 LPs are seeded with $QUEST for different resource types. This creates a robust trading ecosystem where every resource has real economic value and can be monetized through gameplay.

---

## MASTER EDITION VALUE PROPOSITION

Master Editions are the "factories" of the ecosystem:

- **Locked $QUEST Allocation:** Each Master Edition has tokens locked on its Token-Bound Account
- **Clone Minting Revenue:** Earn SOL from every Clone minted (you set the price)
- **Royalty Income:** 50-75% of secondary sales go to the Master Edition's wallet
- **Cannot Be Consumed:** Master Editions are permanent—they can promote others but never burn
- **Can Allocate $QUEST to Clones:** Distribute locked tokens to Clones via even split or bonding curve

---

## THE COMMUNITY-FIRST TGE

The Token Generation Event (Q1 2026) inverts the typical model. Most TGEs: the team dumps tokens on the community. **Critters Quest TGE: the community provides tokens and gets paid.**

### How It Works

1. Stakers can unlock up to 25% of their locked $QUEST allocation to contribute to the TGE pool
2. In return, each participating NFT receives SOL directly to its Token-Bound Account
3. Remaining funds create permanent liquidity for the $QUEST/SOL pool
4. **The team takes zero**—every benefit flows to NFT holders

---

## STAKING (GENESIS QUEST)

Genesis Quest staking allows Master Edition holders to unlock their locked $QUEST over time (0.1%/day + boosts). While staked, holders also earn:

- **XP:** Levels up your Critters for mainnet launch advantage
- **Tool Claims:** Powerful starting equipment for mainnet
- **TGE Participation:** Unlocked tokens can contribute to the community TGE
- **Social Rewards:** Additional rewards through Twitter engagement

---

## SOV MINING MECHANICS (TGE)

The TGE uses SOV Mining (built on ORE Protocol). The concept involves:

- Players stake both locked $QUEST (from their NFT) and SOL
- 5x5 grid rounds (1-5 minutes each) where players deploy stakes to blocks
- Random block wins—winners share the SOL pool and earn liquid $QUEST rewards
- Protocol fees fund buybacks (creating buy pressure) and Master Edition holder revenue
- Built-in deflationary pressure through burns and buybacks

This turns token distribution into an engaging on-chain game while creating sustainable tokenomics.

## IN-GAME SINKS SUMMARY

| SINK TYPE | MECHANISM | EFFECT |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Movement | Pay $QUEST to traverse map | Constant drain from active play |
| Upgrades | Pay $QUEST for buildings/tools | Scaling costs with progression |
| Building Control | Stake $QUEST in map structures | Tokens locked in competition |
| Clone Consumption | Burn Clones to promote characters | Permanent supply reduction |
| Rent (Fresh Finds) | Pay for temporary bonuses | Non-recoverable expenditure |
| Tool Destruction | Tools can break in gameplay | Forces re-crafting spend |

---

## WHY THIS MODEL WORKS

1. **Skilled Gameplay = Earnings:** You don't passively earn tokens. You earn resources through strategy, then decide whether to use them or sell them.

2. **Multiple Sink Layers:** Every action costs something. Movement, upgrades, building control, promotions—tokens constantly leave circulation.

3. **Deflationary Clone Mechanic:** Permanent burning of Clones creates natural scarcity while demand remains constant.

4. **Community-Aligned TGE:** The team doesn't dump on you. The community funds liquidity and gets paid.

5. **Real Utility Drives Demand:** $QUEST has actual use cases beyond speculation—you need it to play effectively.

6. **Value Accrues to NFT Holders:** Master Edition owners earn revenue, control clone production, and benefit from ecosystem growth.
