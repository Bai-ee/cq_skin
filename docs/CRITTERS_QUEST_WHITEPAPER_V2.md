# 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Critters Quest** is a comprehensive GameFi ecosystem built on Solana that reimagines how blockchain games should work. We built token sinks first, then wrapped an economy around them.

## The Three Pillars

| Pillar | Purpose | Key Features |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **SOV Mining** | TGE Method | Pre-Mine, fair mining, SOL rewards, perpetual revenue |
| **$QUEST Token** | Ecosystem Currency | 4.09B supply, 59% burned, deflationary |
| **4X Strategy Game** | Utility Layer | Real gameplay, resource earning, clone consumption |

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Supply | 4.09B QUEST |
| Pre-TGE Burn | 59.1% (5.91B burned) |
| Community Allocation | 70.4% |
| Team Allocation | 10% (6mo cliff + 1yr vest) |
| Master Editions | 3,500 (sold out) |
| Initial Circulating | 0.49% |
| TGE Target | Q1 2026 |

## What Makes Us Different

- Largest pre-launch burn in Solana GameFi (59%)
- Community-first Pre-Mine (20M QUEST for 2,500 SOL)
- Fair launch via SOV Mining (no VC dumps)
- Real 4X strategy game (beta live)
- Sustainable tokenomics (game sinks feed treasury)
- Master Edition yield (perpetual SOL revenue)
- Token-Bound Accounts (NFTs own their wallets)
- Resource-based earning (not direct emissions)

---

# 2. THE PROBLEM WITH GAMEFI

## Why 95% of GameFi Projects Fail

**Problem 1: Extractive Tokenomics**
- High inflation (50-100%+ annually)
- No sustainable sinks
- "Play to earn" becomes "play to dump"

**Problem 2: Unfair Distribution**
- VCs get 20-40% at massive discounts
- Team gets 15-25% with short locks
- Community gets dumped on at launch

**Problem 3: No Real Utility**
- Token is just "governance" or staking
- No actual burn mechanisms
- Game is secondary to speculation

**Problem 4: Unsustainable Yields**
- Promise 1,000%+ APY
- Funded by new player money (Ponzi-like)
- Collapses when new players stop

---

# 3. THE CRITTERS QUEST SOLUTION

## Our Philosophy

**Traditional GameFi:** Print tokens → Give to players → Players sell → Death spiral

**Critters Quest:** Players earn resources → Swap for QUEST → Spend for advantages → 20% to treasury → Buybacks burn → Sustainable loop

## Key Differentiators

**1. Community-First Distribution (70.4%)**
- 58.2% Master Editions (bound to NFTs)
- 12.2% SOV Mining (fair distribution)
- 2.4% Genesis Quest rewards

**2. Sustainable Token Sinks**
- Movement costs, upgrades, crafting
- Clone consumption (burns), promotions
- Building control, rent, repairs
- 20% of spending → treasury

**3. Multiple Revenue Streams**
- SOV Mining (SOL + QUEST)
- QUEST Staking (2% SOL)
- ME Revenue (1% SOL + clone royalties)
- Resource trading (The Swap)

**4. Aligned Incentives**
- Team: 6-month cliff + vesting
- ME holders: Perpetual SOL revenue
- Stakers: Passive SOL income
- Buybacks: 7% constant buy pressure

---

# 4. ECOSYSTEM OVERVIEW

## Pillar 1: SOV Mining (TGE Method)

Built on ORE Protocol for provably fair token distribution:
- Pre-Mine: 20M QUEST for 2,500 SOL
- 80% SOL → Liquidity (2,000 SOL)
- 20% SOL → ME contributors by BPS share (500 SOL)
- Fair mining rounds (1 minute each)
- Multiple revenue streams

## Pillar 2: $QUEST Token

The native currency:
- 4.09B total supply
- 59% burned pre-TGE
- Utility in-game
- Staking rewards (earn SOL)
- Deflationary via buybacks

## Pillar 3: 4X Strategy Game

Real game with real utility:
- eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate
- Resource-based earning
- Clone consumption (deflationary)
- 100+ resource pools (The Swap)
- Token-Bound Accounts

# 5. THE $QUEST TOKEN

## Supply & Distribution

**Total: 4,089,481,331 QUEST**

| Allocation | Amount | % | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---|---------|
| Master Editions | 2.38B | 58.2% | Bound to NFTs via TBA |
| SOV Mining | 500M | 12.2% | Fair distribution |
| Team | 409M | 10.0% | 6mo cliff + vest |
| Marketing | 200M | 4.9% | CEX, partnerships |
| Genesis Quest | 100M | 2.4% | Staking rewards |

## What Was Burned (59.1%)

| Category | Amount | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Already Burned | 2.12B | Bonding curve |
| DEX Allocation | 2.0B | Not needed |
| Marketing Excess | 1.7B | Keeping only 200M |
| Team Excess | 591M | Proportional cut |
| **Total** | **5.91B** | **59.1%** |

## Emission Schedule

```
Formula: Treasury Balance / 525,600 minutes
Initial: 500M / 525,600 = ~951 QUEST/round

Progression:
- Month 1: ~951 QUEST/round
- Month 6: ~476 QUEST/round
- Month 12: ~238 QUEST/round
- With game sinks: Stabilizes
```

# 6. TOKEN GENERATION EVENT (TGE)

## The Pre-Mine

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Amount | 20,000,000 QUEST |
| Price | 2,500 SOL total |
| Rate | 8,000 QUEST per SOL |

**SOL Distribution:**
- 80% → Liquidity (2,000 SOL)
- 20% → ME Contributors (500 SOL) - by BPS share

## Why This Model?

| Traditional TGE | Critters Quest |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Team dumps on community | Community provides, gets paid |
| VCs get discounts | No VC allocations |
| Insiders exit at top | Everyone starts equal |
| Presale whales dump | Fair mining distribution |

---

# 7. SOV MINING PROTOCOL

## How It Works

**Step 1:** Deploy SOL on 5x5 grid (25 blocks)
**Step 2:** Random winner selection (1 min rounds, VRF)
**Step 3:** Rewards distributed

## SOL Distribution Per Round

| Recipient | % | Description |
|-----------|---|-------------|
| Winners | 88% | Proportional to stake |
| Buyback & Burn | 7% | Buy QUEST, burn forever |
| QUEST Stakers | 2% | Stake QUEST → Earn SOL |
| ME Contributors | 1% | By BPS share |
| Motherlode Pool | 2% | 1/625 SOL jackpot |

## QUEST Emissions

- ~951 QUEST/round initially
- 10% refining fee on claims
- Decreases as treasury depletes
- Game sinks replenish

## Example Round

```
You stake: 0.1 SOL on Block #13
Your share: 5% of block

If Block #13 wins:
- SOL profit: 0.252 SOL (~$35)
- QUEST: 48 QUEST (~$0.67)
- Total: ~$35.67

If loses: Lose 0.1 SOL, try next round
```

---

# 10. ECONOMIC SINKS

## Where QUEST Leaves Circulation

| Sink | Mechanism | Effect |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Movement | Pay to traverse map | Constant drain |
| Upgrades | Buildings, tools | Scaling costs |
| Crafting | Items, potions | Ongoing spend |
| Building Control | Stake in structures | Locked tokens |
| **Clone Consumption** | Burn for promotion | **Permanent removal** |
| **Promotions** | Consume Clones | **Deflationary** |
| Leveling Up | Characters, towns | Scaling costs |
| Repairing | Fix equipment | Maintenance |
| Rent | Fresh Finds | Non-recoverable |
| Tool Destruction | Tools break | Re-craft spend |

## Token Flow

**In-Game Spending:**
- 20% → Mining Treasury
- 80% → Protocol Revenue
- NOT burned

**Actual Burns:**
- 7% SOV mining buybacks
- Clone consumption
- ONLY burn mechanisms

---

# 11. TOKEN-BOUND ACCOUNTS (TBA)

## Concept

NFTs have their own wallets. Everything is stored ON the NFT:
- QUEST tokens
- Resources
- Tools & equipment
- XP and levels

## Benefits

- **True Ownership:** NFT owns assets
- **Value Accrual:** Everything stays with NFT
- **Easy Trading:** Sell NFT = sell everything
- **Inheritance:** New owner gets full state

---

# 12. THE CLONE ECONOMY

## The Flywheel

1. **Minting:** Players mint Clones, ME earns SOL
2. **Trading:** Secondary sales, ME earns 50% royalties
3. **Consumption:** Clones burned for promotions
4. **Scarcity:** Reduced supply, higher demand

## Deflationary Mechanism

- Clones permanently burned for promotions
- Master Editions CANNOT be consumed
- Constant demand for new Clones
- Perpetual revenue for ME holders

---

# 13. THE RESOURCE ECONOMY (THE SWAP)

## Core Concept

Players earn RESOURCES, not QUEST directly:
- Gather 100+ resource types
- Swap for QUEST via DLMM pools
- Natural price discovery
- Scarce resources = higher prices

## Benefits

- No direct token emissions
- Resources have in-game utility
- Market sets fair prices
- Skill rewarded
- Sustainable economics

---

# 14. REVENUE MODEL

## Sources

| Source | Recipient |
|--------|-----------|
| DLMM Trading Fees (2%) | Team Treasury |
| Game Spending (80%) | Protocol |
| Game Spending (20%) | Mining Treasury |
| Clone Minting | ME Holders |
| Clone Royalties (50%) | ME Holders |
| Mining SOL (1%) | ME Contributors |
| Mining SOL (2%) | QUEST Stakers |

---

# 15. STAKING

## Genesis Quest (ME Holders)

- Stake NFT → Unlock QUEST
- Contribute to mining pool
- Earn 1% mining SOL (by BPS)
- Earn XP, claim tools

## QUEST Staking (Anyone)

- Stake QUEST → Earn 2% mining SOL
- Passive income
- No gameplay required

---

# 17. RISKS & MITIGATION

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Bear market | Ultra-tight float, buybacks |
| Smart contract exploits | Audits, bug bounty |
| Treasury depletion | Dynamic emissions, game sinks |
| Low adoption | Beta engaged, ME incentives |

---

# 18. CONCLUSION

**We're not building a token with a game attached.**
**We're building a game with sustainable token economics.**

- 59% pre-launch burn proves commitment
- SOV mining proves fairness
- Game beta proves delivery
- ME yield proves alignment
- TBA proves true ownership
- Clone economy proves sustainable deflation
